             <p>Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down.
      And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In West Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air". I whistled for a cab and when it came near he license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air". I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom. I was finally there
      to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.</p>
